## Why Vibeyard?

Running AI coding agents in a bare terminal gets messy fast. Vibeyard gives you a proper workspace — multi-session management, split panes, swarm mode, cost tracking, and session resume — so you can focus on building, not juggling terminals.

## Highlights

- **P2P session sharing** — share live terminal sessions with teammates over encrypted peer-to-peer connections (WebRTC), with read-only or read-write modes and PIN-based authentication
- **Multi-session management** — run multiple agent sessions per project, each in its own PTY; use swarm mode for a grid view of all sessions at once and spin up new ones with `Cmd+\`
- **Cost & context tracking** — real-time spend, token usage, and context window monitoring per session
- **Session inspector** — real-time session telemetry with timeline, cost breakdown, tool usage stats, and context window monitoring (`Cmd+Shift+I`)
- **AI Readiness Score** — see how well-prepared your project is for AI-assisted coding, with one-click fixes
- **Session resume** — pick up where you left off, even after restarting the app
- **Light and dark themes** — switch the app appearance from Preferences, including live re-theming of open terminals
- **Smart alerts** — detects missing tools, context bloat, and session health issues
- **Session status indicators** — color-coded dots on each tab show real-time session state (working, waiting, input needed, completed), with optional desktop notifications
- **Embedded browser tab** — open any URL (e.g. `localhost:3000`) in a session tab, toggle element inspection to click any DOM element, and send AI editing instructions with the exact selector, text content, and page URL as context
- **Keyboard-driven** — full shortcut support, built for speed

> Supports Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. More AI CLI providers coming soon.

## Install

Requires at least one supported CLI installed and authenticated: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

### macOS
